# You are probably well aware of the 'birthday paradox'
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem
# Let's try simulating it

# You will need a list for the 365 day calendar
# You will need a set number of people (e.g. 25)
# During each 'trial' you do the following
#	Choose a person
#	Git them a random birthday
#	Store it in the calendar
# Once you have stored all birthdays, check to see if any have the same day
# Do this for many trials to see what the probability of sharing a birthday is

	#fill w rando bdays
	for j in range(ppl):
		bday = random.randint(0, days-1)
		calendar[bday] += 1
	print(calendar)
	
	#check for dups
	for day in calendar:

			dup += 1
			break	# if calendar had collision, then stop
